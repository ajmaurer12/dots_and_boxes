# dots_and_boxes

This project is still ongoing, trying to learn Dots and Boxes with Deep Learning. There is some challenge to there being illegal moves in the game, which is different from the Open AI gym games. So far, the player vs. player version of the game is working, and the computer game is ready for the learning structure.

The code used for learning on this game is based on code posted by Arthur Juliani:
